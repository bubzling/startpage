## Developer's Note

Alright I'm pretty much done with this project, 
but here are a few aspect I could improve on:

- Plan out ui components better before coding, I find myself copy/paste or rewriting code alot (just to make components reusable)
- Handling states better
  - use redux in bigger projects
  - use context in smaller projects. In this one I find myself passing state down the prop tree quite alot
